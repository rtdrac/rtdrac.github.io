# VST Plugin (with Audio Input)

[Download Source Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ch7/zip/LTA_VST_MIDI_AUDIO.zip){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

This plugin can be compiled as a VST FX or synth. The synth version only works with MIDI and the FX version works with both MIDI and audio.

To compile as a VST FX change the following flag in the PluginCode/CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
# set a flag for synth vs fx
set(AudioIn TRUE)
```
